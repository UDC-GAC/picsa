PICSA stands for **Productivity Increase by Cloud Serverless Automation**

The main contributions of PICSA are: 

1. The middleware of FaaS
oriented to allow a high-level productive programming, reduce heavy-loaded applications
runtime and optimize cost/resources efficiency.

2. The extension of BDWatchdog to
monitor cloud activity, which, combined with an information system, will allow automatic
reporting on the target use cases to be tackled.
